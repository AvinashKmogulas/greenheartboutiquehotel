<h2>Our History</h2>
<div class="caption-details">
<p class="pera-dtails">Greenheart Boutique Hotel has been transformed by a passionate wood lover from a stone ruin into a hotel built entirely of wood. Built from the ground up over a period of over 10 years, with only the 4 outer walls remaining standing. Largely using the best natural materials and robust tropical hardwoods, this hotel is ready for the next 400 years. There are no nails or screws in the main constructions. All wood constructions are secured to the wall with 'pin-hole' connections. You will also find this warmth in the handmade reception, Woodyâ€™s pub, restaurant, pool bar, wooden floors and doors, etc. In our hotel rooms all the handmade beds (Deluxe rooms with an extra upper bed can be knitted via a beautiful wooden staircase), exterior shutters desks etc. for maximum comfort. Everything is made with the best Surinamese woods.</p>
